# Project Plan

## Title

Bicycle Traffic and Weather.

## Main Question

How the bicycle traffic is related to the weather?
## Description


Understanding and optimizing bicycle traffic in Münster, which is an important issue due to the city's commitment to sustainable mobility and cycling infrastructure. This project aims to analyze the extensive bicycle count data, combined with local weather information, obtained from various counting points in Münster over the past years.

## Datasources

There are several bicycle counting points in the Münster city area. The Office for Mobility and Civil Engineering provides the number of cyclists counted daily at the bicycle counting stations as well as the weather information recorded in each case collected in Excel files. 

This dataset contains the detailed bicycle count data from the last few years, both on a daily and hourly basis for the selected district. 

The data sets also contain local weather information for the respective time, but it is obtained from: World Weather Online provided by Eco Counter GmbH.

## Work Packages

1. Preprocessing: Clean, format, and prepare the dataset for analysis. This includes handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and structuring the data for further investigation.

2.  Integration: Develop a data integration plan to combine motor vehicle and bicycle datasets into a unified dataset.

3. Exploring:  gain insights into the dataset, including visualization of bicycle traffic patterns, trends, and descriptive statistics. Examine the relationships between weather variables and cycling counts. perform statistical modeling.

4. Analysis: Using Machine Learnin, Time-series analysis and other analysis techniques to provide parking and infrastructure recommendations for policymakers and infrastructure planners to improve bicycle mobility in Münster.
Report and Documentation:

6. Reporting: summarizing findings and insights from the analyses.
Document the data sources, methodologies, and results.
