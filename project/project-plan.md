# Project Plan

## Title

Münster: Energy and greenhouse gas balance 1990 – 2021

## Main Question

"How can Münster enhance its sustainable urban development strategies, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions and reinforcing renewable energy production?"

## Description


The project aims to investigate and provide insights for sustainable urban development in Münster, Germany. The analysis will focus on two key aspects: the development of annual CO2 emissions and the status of renewable electricity and heat production. The primary goal is to explore how promoting cleaner energy sources benefits the environment.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: 

*Development of annual CO2 emissions in Münster
* Metadata URL: [https://mobilithek.info/offers/-6901989592576801458](https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/entwicklung-der-j%C3%A4hrlichen-co2-emissionen-m%C3%BCnster/resource/5e79c3bd-69c3-4ea9-893d#{view-graph:{graphOptions:{hooks:{processOffset:{},bindEvents:{}}}},graphOptions:{hooks:{processOffset:{},bindEvents:{}}}})
* Data URL: [https://mobilithek.info/offers/-5664437831555154589](https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/entwicklung-der-j%C3%A4hrlichen-co2-emissionen-m%C3%BCnster)
* Data Type: XLS

This dataset contains insights about the CO2 emissions (final energy consumption) of the city of Münster in the years 1990-2021.
It is divided into three sheets based on the sector (private households, industry, transport, commercial + other), application (heat, electricity, transport)
or by energy source (natural gas, district heating, heating oil, coal, fuel mix, transport, electricity, other).
  
### Datasource2: 

*Renewable electricity and heat production in the city of Münster
* Metadata URL: https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/erneuerbare-strom-und-w%C3%A4rmeproduktion-der-stadt-m%C3%BCnster/resource/1dfe1a0c-ad3f-44ea-a4bd#{view-graph:{graphOptions:{hooks:{processOffset:{},bindEvents:{}}}},graphOptions:{hooks:{processOffset:{},bindEvents:{}}}}
* Data URL: https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/erneuerbare-strom-und-w%C3%A4rmeproduktion-der-stadt-m%C3%BCnster
* Data Type: XLS

This dataset contains the data on the production of electricity and heat through renewable energies for the same time period.


## Work Packages

1. Preprocessing: Clean, format, and prepare the dataset for analysis. This includes handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and structuring the data for further investigation. [i1]

2. Integration: Develop a data integration plan to combine the renewable energy production dataset and CO2 emissions development in Münster. [i2]

3. Exploring:  Gain insights into the datasets to understand trends and patterns. Examine the relationships between renewable energy production dataset and CO2 emissions development. [i3]

4. Analysis: Using analysis techniques for in-depth insights. [i4]
   
5. Generate insights: Provide recommendations for policymakers and energy planners based on the analysis. [i5]

6. Reporting: summarizing findings and insights from the analyses. Present results in a clear and accessible format. Document the data sources, methodologies, and results. [i5]
