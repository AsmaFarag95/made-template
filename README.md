#  Münster: Energy and Greenhouse Gas Balance 1990 – 2021


This [Report](https://github.com/AsmaFarag95/made-template/blob/main/project/report.ipynb) explores the relationship between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions using data engineering and time series analysis. By transforming, analyzing, and applying ARIMA models to the data, valuable insights into the trends and patterns observed are obtained.


The analysis leverages publicly available datasets from openopendata.stadt-muenster.de and employs the Python programming language. The central question addressed is, "How can Münster enhance its sustainable urban development strategies, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions and reinforcing renewable energy production?"


## Project Work

Clean, format, and prepare datasets, addressing missing values and ensuring data consistency.
Then, develop a data integration plan to combine datasets on renewable energy production and CO2 emissions in Münster.
 
After that gain insights into datasets to understand trends, patterns and relationships between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions. 
 

An inportant aspect is to implement the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series forecasting and evaluate its performance.

### Future work ☘️☘️☘️


In future work, the aim is to extend ARIMA to multivariate time series analysis, incorporating renewable energy production data to gain a deeper understanding of its impact on CO2 emission patterns. This approach will enhance our ability to make informed decisions and accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.
