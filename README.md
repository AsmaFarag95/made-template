#  Münster: Energy and Greenhouse Gas Balance 1990 – 2021



This project explores the relationship between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions using data engineering techniques. By transforming, analyzing and visualizing the data, valuable insights into the trends and patterns are obtained. 


The analysis leverages publicly available datasets from opendata.stadt-muenster.de and employs the Python programming language. The central question addressed is, "How can Münster enhance its sustainable urban development strategies, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions and reinforcing renewable energy production?"

## Project Work

Clean, format, and prepare datasets, addressing missing values and ensuring data consistency.
Then, develop a data integration plan to combine datasets.
 
After that gain insights into datasets to understand trends, patterns and relationships between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions.
