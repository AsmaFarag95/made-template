# AMSE/SAKI 2023 Template Project
This template project provides some structure for your open data project in the AMSE/SAKI module.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee) installed. We will work with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The easiest way to do so is to set up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

## Project Setup
The following files are part of this template repository as examples and should be **replaced by you** over the semester:

- `data.sqlite`: Your final, cleaned dataset. You will create an automated data pipeline that creates this SQLite database from multiple open data sources. The template repository includes data about train stations in germany, you need to replace this with your data!
- `exploration.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that you can use to explore your data and show in detail what it looks like. You can refer to this file in your report for users that want more information about your data.
- `report.ipynb`: Your final report as a Jupyter notebook. This is the result of your project work and should lead with a question that you want to answer using open data. The content of the report should answer the question, ideally using fitting visualizations, based on the data in `data.sqlite`.


## Exercises
During the semester you will need to complete exercises, sometimes using [Python](https://www.python.org/), sometimes using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee). You **must** place your submission in the `exercises` folder in your repository and name them according to their number from one to five: `exercise<number from 1-5>.<jv or py>`. At the end of the semester, you must have the following files in your repository for full marks:

1. `./exercises/exercise1.jv` or `./exercises/exercise1.py`
2. `./exercises/exercise2.jv` or `./exercises/exercise2.py`
3. `./exercises/exercise3.jv` or `./exercises/exercise3.py`
4. `./exercises/exercise4.jv` or `./exercises/exercise4.py`
5. `./exercises/exercise5.jv` or `./exercises/exercise5.py`

### Grading Feedback
We provide automated grading feedback using a GitHub action (that is defined in `.github/workflows/grading-feedback.yml`). To view your grading feedback, navigate to Actions -> Grading Feedback in your repository (or use the direct link [/actions/workflows/grading-feedback.yml](/actions/workflows/grading-feedback.yml)).

The grading feedback is executed whenever you make a change in files in the `exercise` folder. To see the feedback, open the latest GitHub Action run, open the `grading-feedback` job and `Grading Feedback` step. You should see command line output that contains output like this:

```sh
Found exercises/exercise1.jv, executing model...
Found output file airports.sqlite, grading...
